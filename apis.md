description: Budget Your Trip allows travelers to plan and track trip expenses with
  an easy to use interface. Expenses are broken down with charts, graphs, and tables.
  The website benefits independent travelers that desire a comprehensive breakdown
  of travel expenses.Travel expenses are entered by current travelers to categorize
  costs. This financial data is aggregated and used to develop average travel costs
  for other travelers estimating future expenses. Budget Your Trip is one of the first
  trip planning tools to use real time data provided by travelers to estimate costs
  and breakdown expenses on a detailed geographic and categorical level. An upsurge
  in independent travel has created a demand for travel planning tools with accurate
  and current information. Independent travelers are scouring the web for approximate
  travel costs and web based tools to assist them with trip planning. The &#8220;Gap
  Year&#8221; or &#8220;Travel Year&#8221; concept, which began in Europe, has taken
  hold in the United States. Budget Your Trip meets the demands of this growing group
  by providing them with a tool to monitor their expenses, see their breakdown of
  spending, and predict future costs.The proliferation of internet availability in
  developing countries provides travelers with immediate access to technology and
  communication tools at an unprecedented level. Internet applications are now allowing
  travelers to stay in touch with friends and family via email, blogs, and social
  networks. Budget Your Trip builds on this trend by providing a budgeting tool and
  data gathering resource. Travelers can submit and monitor their own personal financial
  data from anywhere in the world.The Budget Your Trip expense tracking tool gathers
  data from an otherwise unmonitored group. Independent budget travelers typically
  use cash to purchase products and services from local businesses in foreign cities.
  Thus, much of their spending is not tracked or recorded by the travel industry.
  Budget Your Trip provides a means for the commercial travel industry to understand
  the spending habits of travelers that are not utilizing a travel agency, tour company,
  or industry specialist.
